#Online Recipe Book

###Project Abstract
The online recipe book is a simplistic web application for easy storage, access, and sharing of cooking recipes.  Many people have a trove of old recipes written out and handed down through generations.  If sauce spills on your grandmotherâ€™s recipe for Bolognese, the knowledge is lost forever.  The online recipe book supplies a free and modern solution for treasured recipes.  As a web application, the content will be accessible from any device capable of connecting to the internet.  User accessibility is an important goal of this project and will be achieved by utilizing responsive web design and simple text-based content.

###Project Relevance
As a standalone application the largest educational goals of this project will be project management and architecture design.  Managing the project will require skills in version control, testing, and building the application. It is necessary for web applications to combine many different technologies for a final product and designing the system will require tools like Unified Modeling Language to describe use cases and architecture.  Additionally, the core functionality of the application requires accessing a database to dynamically manage content for the user.

###Project Details
Development will focus on dynamic content presented to the user.  There will be a simple and accessible front end written with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  The decision to exclude a JS framework is specific to prevent the inhibition of collaboration with students inexperienced with any frameworks.  Dynamic content will require utilizing multiple technologies in concert to enable persistent storage and retrieval from a server.   I propose the creation of a Web API that uses JSP, Java, and MySQL to achieve dynamic content.  The JSP and Java code will handle requests from the user by accessing the MySQL database and converting the data to JSON format.  The content can then be served to the website frontend.
